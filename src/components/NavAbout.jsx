                    <p>
                        Hello there! I'm <span>Shubham Silyan</span>, a 23-year-old enthusiast hailing from the culturally vibrant city of <span>Amritsar</span>. With a penchant for technology and a thirst for learning, I embarked on a journey that led me to explore the realms of computer science and web development.
                        I hold a <span>Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications with a specialization in Internet of Things (IOT) from the prestigious University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun.</span> My academic pursuits provided me with a solid foundation in understanding the intricate workings of modern technology and its applications.
                        Eager to translate theory into practice, I delved deeper into the world of web development. I honed my skills during a rigorous 6-month training program as a Full Stack Web Developer at Speed Techno Institute in Chandigarh. This immersive experience equipped me with the necessary tools and expertise to navigate the dynamic landscape of web development.
                        My skill set encompasses a diverse range of technologies including <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, C, C++, and various APIs.</span> I thrive in leveraging these tools to create seamless and intuitive web experiences that resonate with users.
                        As a fresher in the field, I am fueled by a relentless drive to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible. With each project, I aim to not only meet but exceed expectations, delivering solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
                        In a world driven by technology, I am committed to continuous growth and evolution, embracing new challenges with enthusiasm and determination. Through my work, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of web development, leaving a lasting impact on users and stakeholders alike.
                        Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring opportunities for collaboration and growth.
